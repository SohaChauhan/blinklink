## About the BlinkLink

This is my Full Stack Web Development project which is under development right now. The project is to develop a clone of LinkTree where the user can have his/her personalized page with custom URL where he/she can put various links to social accounts and websites add that custom URL to any bio or share it to anyone.

The project uses technologies like NextJS, TailwindCSS, NextAuthJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB.  

Here are some of the screenshots of the webpages developed till now. This is still under development so this is not the final ones.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
